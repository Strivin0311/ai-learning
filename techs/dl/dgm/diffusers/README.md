# Diffusers

A sub-repository about Diffusers (Diffusion Models), a new kind of deep generative models prevailing in CV in very recent years from 2020

It is hard to well-classify Diffusers, so the expedient method is to give a taxomony by model structures and applications

## Table of Contents
* [Vanilla Diffuser](./vanilla.md)
  Some resources about the vanilla diffusion models introduced by the team of Y.Song
* [Improved Diffuser](./improved.md)
  Some resources about the works to improve the model structure of vanilla diffusers, like latent-space diffusers and diffusers based on SDE
* [Faster Diffuser](./faster.md)
  Some resoources about the specific works to speed up the inference of vanilla Diffusers, like faster sampling methods
* [Applications](./app.md)
  Some resources about the applications of diffusers beyond high-resolution image synthesis, like text-to-image, video-process and robotics
* [Survey](./survey.md)
  Some resources about the surveys of Diffusers
