# Generative Adversarial Networks

A sub-repository about Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs), a kind of deep generative models prevailing in CV for a long time in years from 2014 to 2019

It's hard to well-classify the GANs, so an expedient method is to give a taxonomy based on structures and training strategies

## Table of Contents
* [Vanilla GANs](./vanilla.md)
  Some resources about GANs in the vanilla structure and loss function
* [Improved GANs](./improved.md)
  Some resources about works upgrading GANs' structure or loss function to improve their training stability
* [Hierarchy GANs](./hierarchy.md)
  Some resources to use GAN as a component for a model in a hierarchy structure, such as two or more GANs work together
* [Fused GANs](./fused.md)
  Some resources to fuse GANs with other DGMs, like VAE, Diffusers, ViT
* [Survey](./survey.md)
  Some surveys on GANs
