# Scenario Generation 
*Here're some resources about Scenario Generation*

Intros:

* Scenario generation for ADS testing refers to the creation of specific driving conditions or situations to evaluate and validate the performance of autonomous vehicles. The purpose is to expose the AVs to a wide range of potential driving scenarios, to ensure they can handle these safely and efficiently.

* The generated scenarios not only cover simple ones like driving on a straight road, turing left/right at the corner, to more complex ones such as navigating a busy intersection with pedestrians, other vehicles, and changing traffic signals in a normal and natural way(Natural Traffic Flow), but also include dealing with tough road obstacles, adverse weather conditions, or emergency situations(Safety-Critical Scenario).
