# High-Definition(HD) Map
*Here're some resources about High-Definition(HD) Map*

Intros:
* This is an introduction about High-Definition(HD) Map technology, a form of highly detailed digital maps that offer a rich, granular representation of the real-world environment and provide critical static information about the road network especially beyond what can be seen by onboard sensors.

* However, the creation and maintenance of HD maps present challenges due to the immense data requirements and the need for frequent updates. 

* As a result, A variety of methods are currently being explored to automate and enhance the process of creating HD map, and improve the data structure and storage format.

* Nevertheless, here is another popular direction in the field seeking lightweight and flexible alternatives to HD map, like using [panoptic segmentation](../../perception_and_prediction/panoptic_segmentation/README.md) or [BEV representation](../../perception_and_prediction/miscellaneous/README.md) to understand the environment globally. But we do not concern about it right here, leaving it to the [perception module](../../perception_and_prediction/README.md).
