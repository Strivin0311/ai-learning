# ðŸš¦ðŸš— ADS-Learning ðŸ“‘ðŸ“š

This repository is dedicated to sharing comprehensive literature on the full-stack techniques for autonomous driving systems(ADS), including modeling, testing and some awesome (open-source) utilities.

*Note*:
* In each markdown file, the collected paper may be roughly sorted by the `published year` in descending order, i.e. the newer the paper, the topper it will be put on the file, but it's not one-hundred percent sure since the `published year` is not always clear.
* The taxonomy is too complicated to be orthogonal, so don't be confused when the same paper is collected in different tracks for many times.
