# ai-learning
A repository to learn the technologies and applicated tasks in the multiple fields of AI, especially the author's own `main interested fields`, with resources including influential papers / github-repos, classical textbooks, and some example notebook codes, etc


*Note*:
* In each markdown file, the collected paper may be roughly sorted by the `published year` in descending order, i.e. the newer the paper, the topper it will be put on the file, but it's not one-hundred percent sure since the `published year` is not always clear.
* The taxonomy is too complicated to be orthogonal, so don't be confused when the same paper is collected in different tracks for many times.
